1) what is js meaning
	JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, 
	in web applications,for game development

2) short circuit : circuit evaluation avoids unnecessary work and leads to efficient processing.
if you have something like a && b, and a is false,
 JavaScript won't br checking b because it already 
 knows result will be false

3) js engine: it convert js code into computer understanding language

4)diff btw filter and find:
// find() method of Array instances returns first element in provided array that satisfies provided testing function. If no values satisfy testing function, undefined is returned.

// filter data
//  first position of an array elements

// find search data
// return data which match condition

5)parseInt :   parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer


6)what is filter:   
// filter() returns an array containing
// element that satisfies condition

7) slice and splice
// ........... slice ......... from where to where have to execute data in array
// slice() method of Array instances returns
// a shallow copy of a portion of an array into
// a new array object selected from start to end

// (end not included) where start and end represent
// index of items in that array. original array
// will not be modified


// ............. splice .......... from where to where have to add data in array
// splice() method of Array
//instances changes contents of an array by removing or replacing
// existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.

8)spread and rest:
spread:
 It's commonly used to concatenate or combine arrays. 

9)regular expression :

10) parameter and argument in js: default parameter
11) type coercion
12) operator precedence
13) higher order function
14) currying function
15) Manipulating DOM
16) template literal and string interpolation

17) push() : push a value in array
	pop() : Removing Last Element from Array
	shift() : removes first element from an array and returns it
	unshift() : adds elements to beginning of an array and returns new length.
	find() : 
	filter() :it refers to a method available on arrays
	that allows you to create a new array containing
	elements that pass a certain condition. The filter()
	method iterates over each element of the array and
	applies a callback function to each element. If the
	callback function returns true for an element, that
	element is included in the new array. If the callback
	function returns false, the element is excluded.




23)Higher-order function:
Higher-order function that takes a function as an argument

24) a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking only one argument. The curried function returns another function until it has received all its arguments, at which point it evaluates and returns the result.



26) template literal :
it allows string interpolation and multiline strings. They are enclosed by backticks (``) instead of single or double quotes.
ex - console.log(`hello i'm 
ismial`);

string interpolation
the process of embedding expressions or variables within a string to dynamically construct the string's content. It allows you to create strings with placeholders that are replaced with the actual values of variables or the results of expressions.
Inside a template literal, you can use ${} to insert variables or expressions.
ex - console.log(`hello mr/mis ${name}`);
