// operator precedence :
// Sure! Here's a list of JavaScript operators sorted by precedence, from highest to lowest:
//1. Grouping: `()` - Parentheses always have the highest precedence. They're used to control the order of operations explicitly.
//2. Member Access: `.` - Dot notation for accessing properties of objects.
//3. Computed Member Access: `[]` - Bracket notation for accessing properties of objects.
//4. Function Call: `()` - Calling functions or methods.
//5. Increment/Decrement: `++`, `--` - Prefix or postfix increment and decrement operators.
//6. Logical NOT: `!` - Logical NOT operator for negating a value.
//7. Bitwise NOT: `~` - Bitwise NOT operator for inverting bits.
//8. Unary Plus/Minus: `+`, `-` - Unary plus and minus operators for converting to numbers and negating.
//9. Typeof: `typeof` - Operator for determining the type of a value.
//10. Void: `void` - Operator for evaluating an expression and returning `undefined`.
//11. Exponentiation: `**` - Exponentiation operator for raising a base to the power of an exponent (ES2016).
//12. Multiplication/Division/Remainder: `*`, `/`, `%` - Multiplication, division, and remainder operators.
//13. Addition/Subtraction: `+`, `-` - Addition and subtraction operators.
//14. Bitwise Shift: `<<`, `>>`, `>>>` - Bitwise left shift, bitwise right shift, and unsigned right shift operators.
//15. Relational/Comparison: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `instanceof`, `in` - Comparison operators for comparing values.
//16. Equality/Inequality: `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==` - Equality and inequality operators for comparing values.
//17. Bitwise AND: `&` - Bitwise AND operator.
// 18. Bitwise XOR: `^` - Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator.
// 19. Bitwise OR: `|` - Bitwise OR operator.
// 20. Logical AND: `&&` - Logical AND operator.
// 21. Logical OR: `||` - Logical OR operator.
// 22. Conditional (Ternary) Operator: `? :` - Conditional operator for conditional expressions.
//23. Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `<<=`, `>>=`, `>>>=`, `&=`, `^=`, `|=` - Assignment operators for assigning values to variables.
//24. Comma: `,` - Comma operator for evaluating multiple expressions, returning the result of the last one.

//Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence. Use parentheses to override precedence and control the order of evaluation.
